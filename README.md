You must open Assign3.html in your browser to run the program
I implemented the ability to create a triangle and a square on the canvas with a mouse click
I deleted some of the instructor comments and code just to clean up Assign3.js a little
If you want to run the version without the colors automatically changing, I have commented out the other option of the render function to run inside of Assign3.js
A cool next step would be to add the functionality to be able to create random squares and triangles as you drag the mouse on the canvas
